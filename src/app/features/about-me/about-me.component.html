<h2>About me</h2>

<div class="about-me">
  <p>
    I’m a <strong>Front-End / Full-Stack JavaScript Developer</strong> with <strong>over 10 years</strong> of experience building web solutions — from clean, responsive interfaces to large-scale enterprise platforms.
  </p>

  <p>
    I started with classic front-end development using <strong>HTML, CSS, and jQuery</strong>, and gradually evolved into modern frameworks like <strong>Angular, TypeScript, NestJS</strong>, and <strong>Node.js</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Throughout my career, I’ve worked in both <strong>outsourcing</strong> companies and <strong>product</strong> teams, where I was responsible for front-end <strong>architecture, microservice</strong> development, <strong>mentoring</strong> junior developers, and conducting strong <strong>code reviews</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    I enjoy writing <strong>clean, structured</strong>, and <strong>maintainable</strong> code, designing thoughtful interfaces, and creating solutions that combine <strong>usability, performance</strong>, and <strong>reliability</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Currently, I’m focused on advancing in software architecture and technical leadership, while continuously improving my approach to building <strong>scalable front-end systems</strong>.
